* .emacs.d
Personal Emacs configuration. It's bad and probably not useful for anyone
apart from me.

** Note
If you are planning to use Emacs, just don't bother. Use
[[https://github.com/neovim/neovim][NeoVim]] instead. If you just want an
extensible editor and *editor* only, don't touch Emacs. You can check out my
[[https://github.com/azahi/dotfiles][dotfiles]] for a relatively sufficient
Vim configuration example.

NeoVim has it all: API for plugin support via buttload of langauges,
/native/ LSP support, modern and sensible defaults, async that actually works,
fast and slick rendering (sometimes), GUIs if you don't like terminals, and etc.
Did I mention that it's fast?

Consider Emacs only if:
- You *love* Lisp.
- You want to use the infamous `org-mode', `elfeed', `mu4e' and some other
  /killer feature/ that only Emacs has.
- You are not afraid of reading walls of documentation.
- You have a lot of free time.
- You can /tolerate/ a piece of bloated mess that Emacs is by design.
